# GLCM_featureExtraction+ClassificationProject

In this project, I have used the GLCM (Gray Level Covariance matrix) to implement a feature extraction model.
Extracted 4 main features including contrast, energy, correlation and homogeneity.
Used that features to classify the samples of an MRI dataset into tumor & non-tumor category using logistic regression model.

Achieved an accuracy of 87.50%
